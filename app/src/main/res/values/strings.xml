    <string name="fq_1">How can I delete my notes or tasks?</string>
    <string name="fa_1">You can slide your note/task to the left and it\'ll delete the same. There\'ll
        be a snackbar at the bottom for few seconds to undo it if done mistakenly. Deleted notes will
        be stored in Trash for a selected time period before auto-removal and deleted tasks are non-recoverable.</string>

    <string name="fa_2">You can not. This app works offline and doesn\'t need you to login/register in
        order to use. So your data is not stored in server and it cannot be synced.</string>
